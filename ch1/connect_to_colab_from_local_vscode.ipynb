    "\n",
    "Note for Conda: you need to run some extra code in Colab in order to get access to Conda in Colab. Follow the tutorial [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/conda-google-colab-75f7c867a522) if you really want to use Conda. Personally, I would recommend against it since it takes longer to install. Try using pip, pip-tools or poetry instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my case, I create a Makefile for every project and then I simply need to enter `make poetry` in the terminal. To create a Makefile, simply create a file called `Makefile` in your project directory. Then, in the Makefile, you can add the following (or whatever installation commands you want for your specific dependency manager):"

    "\n",
    "To prevent having to create a notebook for every project, do the following to things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Do your package installations in VSCode rather than Colab. Then you only need to install the packages for a specific project.\n",

    "### You are Asked for Username and Password\n",

    "This could mean a few things, so I'll go over the ones I encountered:\n",
    "\n",
    "1: Your Remote - SSH config file is not correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to \"Remote - SSH: Settings\" and make sure that you are using the correct config file like the one below:\n",

    "![remote-ssh-settings-config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JayThibs/jacques-blog/master/images/remote-ssh-settings-config.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "2:  Colab is still running `init_git_cloudflared` because you did not pass it a valid personal access token.\n",

    "### No Access to GPU?\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't forget to go to Runtime > Change Runtime Type and select \"GPU\" in Colab!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Can't Find Repository?\n",
